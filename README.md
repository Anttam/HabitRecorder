#Habit Recorder

this app is a Good or Bad Habit tracker. I was inspired to create this app after reading the book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. 

In the book, there is a section talking about the difference between having a good or bad day is the sum of the habits we perform throughout it. The idea is that if you follow multiple tiny habits (or "votes" as Clear describes it) you will gradually mold yourself into the person you envision your self as. In the section describing this idea, there is a graphic that looks very similar to a binary search tree, which triggered something in my brain that said "this is meant to become an app!"

## Goal of this project

My main goal is to create an entire full stack webapp that takes input data (a +1 or -1 depending on the button), sends it to a backend that then stores the data in a database. Then, at 9 PM EST, the backend pulls the data and sends a text or email notfication saying "you had a {good or bad} habbit day today". I may also add a weekly or monthly summary but I'm not 100% sold on that idea yet. Also, I would like to deploy this app on a raspberry Pi. 

## Methods

### React

I have followed through about 95% of a react course and would like to try a crack at building the front end on my own with this. I feel like it's overkill for the scope of this project but I still think it's great practice for secondary skills like folder management, naming conventions, package management etc.

### Go Lang

I have seen that Go Lang has pretty good HTTP server functionality built into it and I have never actually used it before. I like the idea of "trial by fire" learning a new language as I've seen that it's a very effective method to learn the practicality of a language. 

### SQL / Postgres

I took a SQL querying course a good while back and I used postgres and PG Admin to run pretty bare bones queries. I have a bit of experience with some No-SQL databases by using Firebase for the React course but I like the idea of getting to try out using SQL in a project. 


## Conclusion

This is more or a learning project then the next ground breaking app. I'm really busy with work lately and not sure when I'll have time to get around to fleshing this out but I feel like a fee commits here and there isn't that difficult. I really like the idea of learning by doing and I'm excited to get the ball rolling on this one!
